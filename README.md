# my achievments in 2017's vacation

## what is it ?

in this vacation I'm planning to be a Full stack Developer and work on many projects
to have a good prortfolio and to get some job to support my financials.
also along the way, I will reading about the Machine Learning since I'm pretty passionate
about it.
## what I will be doing?.

starting from 28-June I will be writing notes in the [wiki](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ayman/My-2017-Vacation/wiki)
as well as uploading my projects in the repo.

before that time  i was doing the notes in mark down files but currently I think
that the wiki would be better specifically after seeing this [repo](https://github.com/Rafase282/My-FreeCodeCamp-Code) by [Rafase](https://github.com/Rafase282) .

## why is this?
I do this sort of recording my achievments since I lose my passion very quickly
since the atmosphere around me isn't really motivating me for doing anything, so
this sort of recording is really helpful for me to keep on track and hopefully
my notes would help somebody
my achievments so far ..

## How can you support me ?

you could do so by checking out my projects and tell me if there were any sorta bugs or best practices,
also some Stars would be very motivating and very appreciated : )
