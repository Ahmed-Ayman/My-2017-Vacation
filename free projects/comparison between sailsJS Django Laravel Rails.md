MVC -> very custombizable.

CMS -> a lot of templates,plugins but limited.

all of the MVC are considering the reusability,'dont repeat yourself'.

all has good Security : csrf tokens / middleware, but django is the most secure and Laravel is the most unsecure.

all are creating database tables and auto SQL queries , secure routing system.

SailsJS vs express :

*  Node.js ships with a very basic set of http libraries.
* Express.js wraps those http libraries and helps to enable things like routing, static serving, sessions, cookies, etc. But it really knows nothing about the DB.
* Sails.js wraps express and provides another higher level for doing things like connecting to the DB, auto-generating input pages, etc.
